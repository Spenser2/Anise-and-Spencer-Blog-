    <h2>Be Very Afraid</h2>
    <img src="css-sheet/Doom.webp">
    <p>My favorite trip during summer was one of my notoriously dangerous hikes to the one and only Mt Doom, which is located at the peak of each nightmarish memory inside every boy and girl from <strong>Missouri</strong>.
    <p>The only way to survive such a terrible experience, I have learned, is by overcoming your fear of dragons, lonliness, and fried okra.</p>
    <p>If you are able indeed able to survive the trial, you will be rewarded with pride, strength, resiliance, and <strong>tenacity!</strong></p>
      <div class="sidebar">
        <ul>
          <li>You will be afraid...</li>
          <li>Very, very afraid...</li>
          <li> One thing is for certain: The peak of Mt Doom contains a view of smoke and death.
          <li>Well, maybe it isn't too scary...</li>
          <li>Nah, it's definitely pretty scary...</li>
        </ul>
